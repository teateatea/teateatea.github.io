## White Marble Statue
**[[A fair maiden]]** (long, flowing hair and robe, upon her brow a star).

**Blindfolded** (a black cloth is wrapped around the statue’s head, covering her eyes).
**Round plinth** (also of marble, 3’ across, 1’ high).

▶ **Removing the blindfold:** The inside of the cloth is embroidered with golden [[crucifixes]].

## Stairs Down to the [[14 Warded Pool]]
**Pristine** (finely cut stone, free of dust).
**Tree-branch archway** (stone carved into the likeness of interwoven trees, at the top of the stairway).

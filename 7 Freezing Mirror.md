## Full-Length Mirror
**Silver frame** (beautifully wrought, engraved with [[crucifixes]] and unicorns at play). **Hung from the wall** (behind the statue plinth).

▶ **Passing in front:** Save vs paralysis or be frozen still.
▶ **Covering the mirror:** Bypasses the freezing effect.
▶ **Value:** 1,000gp material value.
▶ **Removing from the tomb:** Its magical properties fade after one month.
▶ **Unfreezing people:** Holy water, [[cure light wounds]], or sunlight.

## Empty Statue Plinth
**White marble** (round, 3’ across, 1’ high).
**Scratches on the floor** (as if a heavy statue was dragged away, towards the [[5 Hall of Guardians|western hallway]]).

## Stairs Down to the [[14 Warded Pool]]
**Pristine** (finely cut stone, free of dust).
**Tree-branch archway** (stone carved into the likeness of interwoven trees, at the top of the stairway).

▶ **Illuminating the stairs:** Reveals the shimmering of reflections off water.

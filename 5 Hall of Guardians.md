## Atmospherics
**Musty** (dank, stifling air).
**Wet** (ceiling and walls).

## 4 [[Religious Animated Objects|Religious Objects]]
**Standing on plinths** (in the corners of the room).
**Mouldy** (covered with mustard-coloured fur).

▶ **Items:** All about 1’ tall.
- A silver crucifix (200gp), 
- a wooden statue of a cherub, 
- a holy book, 
- a huge candle.

▶ **Reaction:** If a non-Lawful character sets foot in the room, the objects float into the air and attack. (Lawful as defined by how well they maintain their blades. Oiled, sharpened, stropped, hilt wrapped, etc.)

- **Scolding:** When animated, the objects speak in a shrill, sanctimonious tone, scolding PCs for their misdeeds (including entering the tomb).
- **When killed:** A cloud of mould spores erupts. **Anyone in melee: save vs poison,** or suffer 1d2 damage and choke for 1 round (cannot act)

````ad-quote
title:Sanctimonious Scolding
collapse: close
1. "Disturbers of the holy tombs!"
2. "You sully the Pilgrim's Path with your dulled senses and loathsome breath!"
3. "No worship of His Guides, no practice of His forms."
4. "We hear your pathetic thoughts! Empty skulls full of weakness, yawnsome delusions what foul your veins!"

5. "Sedge would spit on your greed!"
6. "Your desires tarnish your bones, poison your blood!"
7. "Not one blade oiled at dawn, not one hilt wrapped by our guides. Deplorable is what you are!"
8. "He will thicken and bind your scummy blades."

9. "Our wrath burns with his holy oil!"
10. "Death falls upon you!"
11. "Grave diggers! Tomb robbers! Food stealers!"
12. "Vacuous miscreants! Malodourous discharge!"

## Double Doors
**Heavy stone** (streaked with damp).
**Inscription** (“The Most Dear”).

## Dusty Floor
▶ **If disturbed:** Movement in the room reveals colours beneath the dust.
▶ **If cleared:** A mosaic is revealed, along with scratches on the floor.
▶ **The mosaic:** Depicts [[Sir Chyde]] atop a white charger, piercing the heart of a fairy knight with his sword. An inscription in [[Old Woldish]] reads “Here lies the noble Sir Chyde, slayer of Frost, defender of the King”. Speakers of modern Woldish can recognise the name and the words for “Frost” and “King”. 
- “HERE LIES THE NOBLE SIR CHYDE, SLAYER OF FROST, DEFENDER OF THE KING.”
- "YMA Y GORWEDD YR BONHEDDIG SYR CHYDE, LLADDWR FROST, AMDDIFFYNWR Y BRENIN." (or KING for the last word?)
▶ **The scratches:** Looks like something heavy was dragged from [[7 Freezing Mirror|the eastern hallway (area 7)]] (a long time ago).

## Mouldy Writing Desk
**Decaying wood** (carved with angels).

▶ **Locked drawer:** Easily smashed open.
▶ **Inside the drawer:** An old, mould-covered book—pages stuck together with damp, indecipherable.
▶ **Inside the book cover:** A brass sheet, inscribed with a pastoral poem about [[Sir Chyde]] hunting with his favoured dogs. One of the dogs is named: [[Flaegr]].

## A Loose Flagstone
▶ **Locating:** A search for secret doors or traps will find it.
▶ **Underneath:** A small space containing a locked metal box.
▶ **The lock is trapped:** With a poison needle: **save versus poison** or suffer 1d6 damage and fall unconscious for 1d6 turns.
▶ **Inside the box:** A silver [[crucifix]] (50gp), a clerical scroll of [[Hold Person Spell]], a prayer book of stamped gold leaf (worth 500gp), a box of 20 holy wafers—preserved after all these years! (They are magical—each cures 1hp.)

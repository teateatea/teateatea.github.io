## 2 Floating Skeletons
**Dancing** (arm in arm, slowly waltz in mid-air above the fissure in the floor).
**Slick with moisture** (covered with **slime vapour**).
**Jewellery** (one wears a pearl necklace, the other a gold medallion, worth 500gp each).

▶ **Reaction:** Welcome strangers to join the dance. Attack vehemently if any of the
coffers are disturbed.
▶ **Language:** Can speak old-fashioned [[Woldish]] (i.e. [[Common]]—not [[Old Woldish]]) in a distant whisper.

### Greeting
- Lady: Look upon this, dear riverstone!
- Lord: I shall send for the servants, the ball carries on til sup, I expect.
- Lord: Guests have appeared, 4 in all!
- Lady: Prithee, guests! Step lightly with us. The fete carries our joy, and yours!

### On party declining to dance
- Lady: Ah modest folk, then? Attend to us but a moment and you shall learn the steps! Let not your character spoil your spirit!
- Lord: I too, was once young and coy. Our guests might comfort themselves in our homes, dearling, in their own measures.

### On party asking questions
- Lady: Let us speak not bleakly of the past. Better to keep spirits high! *(Laughs at her joke)*
- Lord: Prithee, dear guest. Holdst thee mine honour, and more, the lady's. Let us not profane her character with speech such as this.

### Caution
- Lord: Triffle not with these tombs, friend. Prithee, they keep only beneath our sights.

### Last Warning
- Lord: Wilst thee spoil their dozen? Away, lest we touch bone to blade and tarnish *both* our oaths.

## Fissure in the Floor
**Indeterminate depth** (upon first glance).
**Sheets of slime** (transparent, dripping from a hairline crack in the ceiling above. See the **slime vapour**).

▶ **Looking down:** PCs who gaze into the fissure catch glimpses of glimmering light below, like sunlight reflected off snow.
▶ **Delving:** People or objects that descend more than 15’ into the fissure drift down from the sky, snowflake-like, in Fairy [[15 Tower on a Frozen Lake|(area 15)]]. Though the fall seems long, it is harmless.

## Stone Coffers
**A and B lie open** (lids are pushed aside).
**Tarnished brass plaques** (at the foot).

## Brass Plaques on Coffers
**Portraits** (engraved). 
**Names** (along with a relationship to Sir Chyde).

▶ **A:** **Lady** Amaranda (mother): Tall, elegant, stick-like, big nose, holding a book.
▶ **B:** **Lord** Brigforwith (father): Stocky, round head, chunky beard.
▶ **C:** Brandywith the Good (elder brother): Bespectacled, head bowed, leaning on a staff.
▶ **D:** Brigford the Wise (younger brother): Chainmail, hound at his side, bow in hand.
▶ **E:** Emaline the Chaste (sister): Petite, mourning veil, cradling a cat.

## Inside the Coffers
▶ **A, B:** Empty.
▶ **C:** A skeleton with an ash staff.
▶ **D:** A skeleton dressed in rusted mail.
▶ **E:** Two skeletons: one human, one feline.

## The Slime Vapour
**Sheets of slime** (transparent).
**Drips into the fissure** (from a hairline crack in the ceiling).
**Coats the skeletons** (their eternal rest was disturbed by the slime).

▶ **Touching with objects:** The object becomes weightless for a moment.
▶ **Touching with flesh:** Slime rushes over the PC’s whole body in an instant, coating them with a thin layer. The PC becomes lighter than air, drifting up to the ceiling. This is permanent, unless the slime is removed (e.g. [[dispel magic]]).

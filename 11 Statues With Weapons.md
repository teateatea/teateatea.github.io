## 7 Statues of Footmen
**Dark stone** (smooth and finely carved).
**Real weapons** (in their hands—see below).

▶ **[[Flanged mace]]:** With a spiralling hilt.
▶ **[[Morningstar]]:** With 2”-long spikes.
▶ **[[Battle axe]]:** Engraved with a horse’s head.
▶ **[[Warhammer]]:** Head shaped like a boar.
▶ **[[Sir Chyde's Longsword|Longsword]]:** With wavy blood grooves. The sword is enchanted (of fairy construction): +2 to hit and damage. It carries a glamour that affects mortals who wield it, compelling them to attack the largest foe in battle.
▶ **[[Halberd]]:** With a mouldy pennant.
▶ **[[Spear]]:** With serrated blade.

## Mould-Patched Walls
**Yellow and purple** (vivid fuzz).

▶ **Disturbing the mould:** Raises a cloud of spores. Everyone within 10’ must **save versus poison** or suffer 1d4 damage and be stricken with violent coughing and choking for 1 turn.

## Faded Battle Mural
**[[Sir Chyde]]** (on horseback, in battle).
**His right hand** (raised, obscured by mould).
**Hounds** (two hunting hounds at his side, partially obscured by mould).
**Fairy army** (arrayed against the knight).
▶ **The knight’s hand:** If the mould is cleared (**save versus poison**, see above), PCs see a longsword with wavy blood grooves, surrounded with a white glow.
▶ **The hounds:** If the mould is cleared (**save versus poison**, see above), the name of one of the hounds is revealed, written on its collar ([[Chedr]]).

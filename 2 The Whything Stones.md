## Stone Circle
**Rune-etched** (eldritch markings which reflect moonlight).
**Mossy** (clad with dangling beards).

▶ **The runes:** Magical script which (if deciphered) appears to have some function
in rituals of summoning.
▶ **Clearing the moss:** Carved at the base of each stone are images of icy fey figures
wailing and writhing, as if in torment.

## Twitching Stag Skeleton
**Lying amid the stones** (twitching erratically).
**Slime-coated** (bright green, glowing, evaporating).
**Green haze** (lingering cloud of evaporating slime).

▶ **Breathing the haze:** Acrid. Makes one light-headed.

## 13 Iron Owls
**Hanging from trees** (wings spread wide, clanking in the breeze).
**Rusty** (rain streaked).
**Pentagram eyes** ([graven](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/grave)).

▶ **Touching:** A chill comes over the character.
▶ **Natives of Dolmenwood:** Recognise the owls as symbols of the [[The Drune|Drune]].

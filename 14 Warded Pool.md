## Vaulted Chamber
**Shimmering pool** (fills the room).
**Statue of a maiden** (in the centre of the pool, white marble, long, flowing hair and robe, upon her brow a star).

## At the Bottom of the Stairs
**Ghostly candles** (dozens, floating in mid-air).
**Warding the way** (it is not possible to pass the bottom step without passing through the candles).

▶ **Fairy PCs:** Feel the presence of the ageless realm pressing against the ward, from the other side.
▶ **Passing through the candle ward:** (From area 6 or 7.) Characters feel a wave of religious awe. The perceived scene of the vaulted chamber dissolves and reforms into an outdoor scene with a white tower upon an island in a frozen lake—PCs appear in area 15.
▶ **Returning:** Characters who came from the tomb can pass back through the ward, but it is impassable to others.
▶ **Dispelling:** The ward is immune to fairy magic, but can be dispelled by others. Treat as if cast by a 10th level cleric.

```ad-note
title: Referee’s Note
The **vaulted chamber** that characters perceive before passing through the ward is the bottom level of the tomb as it exists in the mortal world. The nature of reality has been warped here by the action of the ring of soul-binding, over the many centuries it has lain in the tomb. Fairy is now more present here than the mortal world.

The wards at the bottom of the stairs were placed by the Church when the tomb was sealed, in order to prevent further encroachment from Fairy.

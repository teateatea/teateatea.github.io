## Door
**Granite slab** (seals the mound).
**Overgrown** (covered in lichen and sweet-smelling wild roses).

▶ **Moving the slab:** Requires a cumulative STR bonus of at least 4.
▶ **Breaking the slab:** Takes 6 turns. Cumulative STR bonuses reduce this time. (Minimum 2 turns.)
___
## Stairs into the Mound
**Descend 20’** (into the earth).
**Dusty** (caked with centuries of undisturbed dust).
**Deathly silence** (disturbed by PCs’ footsteps).
**Dank smell** (moist and mouldy).

▶ **If examined:** Scratches are discovered. Looks like something heavy was dragged up the stairs (a long time ago).

**Massive stone** (smooth surface).
**Inscription** (deeply cut: “Call to the Companions”).
**Locked** (and warded by magic).

▶ **The riddle:** Speaking the names of Sir Chyde’s hounds: “[[Flaegr]] and [[Chedr]]” (or vice versa) causes the doors to open.
▶ **Touching the doors:** Without answering the riddle causes the stone hounds to animate and attack.

## 2 [[Stone Hounds]]
**Chained** (to the base of the door).
**Larger than life** (6’ tall).
